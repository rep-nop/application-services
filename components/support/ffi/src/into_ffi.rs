/// This trait is used to return types over the FFI. It essentially is a mapping between a type and
/// version of that type we can pass back to C (`IntoFfi::Value`).  we need to still pass something
/// back to C in the case of an error.
///
/// The main wrinkle is that we need to be able to pass a value back to C in both the success and
/// error cases. In the error cases, we don't want there to need to be any cleanup for the foreign
/// code to do, and we want the API to be relatively easy to use.
///
/// Additionally, the mapping is not consistent for different types. For some rust types, we want to
/// convert them to JSON. For some, we want to return an opaque `*mut T` handle. For others,
/// we'd like to return by value.
///
/// This trait supports those cases by adding some type-level indirection, and allowing both cases
/// to be provided (both cases what is done in the error and success cases).
///
/// We implement this for the following types:
///
/// - `String`, by conversion to `*mut c_char`. Note that the caller (on the other side of the FFI)
///   is expected to free this, so you will need to provide them with a destructor for strings,
///   which can be done with the [`define_string_destructor!`] macro.
///
/// - All numeric primitives except `bool`, `isize`, and `usize`.
///     - `bool` doesn't seem to be safe to pass over the FFI in all cases (it's possible this was
///       caused by a bug in JNA, but either way, we avoid it). For this case, convert to e.g. a u8
///       and check on the other side.
///     - `isize` and `usize` could be added, but they'd be easy to accidentally misuse, so we
///       currently omit them.
///
/// - `Option<T>` where `T` is `IntoFfi`, by returning `IntoFfi::ffi_default()` for `None`.
///
/// - `Vec<T>` where `T` is `IntoFfi` and [`ffi_support::IntoFfiJsonTag`] (note: you get this
///   automatically with [`implement_into_ffi_by_json!`]), allowing `Vec<T>` to be passed back as
///   JSON if T could be.
///     - In the future, we may do this for `serde_json::Value` and `HashMap<String, T>` as well.
///
/// None of these are directly helpful for user types though, so macros are provided for the
/// following cases:
///
/// 1. For types which are passed around by an opaque pointer, the macro
///    [`implement_into_ffi_by_pointer!`] is provided.
///
/// 2. For types which should be returned as a JSON string, the macro
///    [`implement_into_ffi_by_json!`] is provided.
///
/// See the "Examples" section below for some other cases, such as returning by value.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// This is an unsafe trait (implementing it requires `unsafe impl`). This is because we cannot
/// guarantee that your type is safe to pass to C. The helpers we've providedÂ as macros should be
/// safe to use, and in the cases where a common pattern can't be done both safely and generically,
/// we've opted not to provide a macro for it. That said, many of these cases are still safe if you
/// meet some relatively basic requirements, see below for examples.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ### Returning types by value
///
/// If you want to return a type by value, we don't provide a macro for this, primarially because
/// doing so cannot be statically guarantee that it is safe. However, it *is* safe for the cases
/// where the type is either `#[repr(C)]` or `#[repr(transparent)]`. If this doesn't hold, you will
/// want to use a different option!
///
/// Regardless, if this holds, it's fairly simple to implement, for example:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ffi_support::IntoFfi;
/// #[derive(Default)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// pub struct Point {
///     pub x: i32,
///     pub y: i32,
/// }
///
/// unsafe impl IntoFfi for Point {
///     type Value = Self;
///     #[inline] fn ffi_default() -> Self { Default::default() }
///     #[inline] fn into_ffi_value(self) -> Self { self }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Conversion to another type which is returned over the FFI)
///
/// In the FxA FFI, we have a SyncKey type, which is converted to a different type before returning
/// over the FFI. (The real FxA FFI is a little different, but this is relatively close):
///
/// This is fairly easy to do by performing the conversion inside `IntoFfi`.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ffi_support::{self, IntoFfi};
/// # use std::{ptr, os::raw::c_char};
/// pub struct SyncKeys(pub String, pub String);
///
/// #[repr(C)]
/// pub struct SyncKeysC {
///     pub sync_key: *mut c_char,
///     pub xcs: *mut c_char,
/// }
///
/// unsafe impl IntoFfi for SyncKeys {
///     type Value = SyncKeysC;
///     #[inline]
///     fn ffi_default() -> SyncKeysC {
///         SyncKeysC {
///             sync_key: ptr::null_mut(),
///             xcs: ptr::null_mut(),
///         }
///     }
///
///     #[inline]
///     fn into_ffi_value(self) -> SyncKeysC {
///         SyncKeysC {
///             sync_key: ffi_support::rust_string_to_c(self.0),
///             xcs:      ffi_support::rust_string_to_c(self.1),
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Note: this type manages memory, so you still will want to expose a destructor for this,
/// // and possibly impl Drop as well.
/// ```
